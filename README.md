## Summary of the course

In this course we will introduce the basic ideas and algorithms of supervised
learning and we will implement them using R programming language. A brief
theoretical overview of the so-called learning setting will be provided, then
the main focus will be on showing practical analysis and modelling of data
related to healthcare.

## Learning outcomes

+ To understand concepts of machine learning for healthcare and compare and test
a range of techniques.

+ To classify features of data sources, analysing and interpreting the outputs
of machine learning techniques in the context of practical solutions in the area
of healthcare.

## Detailed Programme

### Day 1: Introduction

What is machine learning? Types of machine learning. Classification and
regression. Training and test sets. Model evaluation. Over-fitting. Overview of
Machine Learning Algorithms. No free lunch theorem. Cross validation. Practical
Examples.

### Day 2: Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

Data analysis and pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, handling missing
data. Feature engineering techniques including but not limited to:
transformations, feature extraction, reduction and selection.

### Day 3: Regression (part 1)

Single and multiple regression. Linear and polynomial regression. Parameter
estimates. Residual analysis. Metrics for model evaluation. Plots and
predictions. Feature selection.

### Day 4: Classification

+ Logistic Regression: why logistic regression; logistic function; simple
logistic regression; multiple logistic regression (tentative); ROC curve;
feature interpretation; predictions using logistic regression.

+ Decision Trees: classification using decision trees; understanding and
visualising decision trees; advantages and disadvantages of decision trees;
predictions.

+ Random Forests: from decisions trees to random forests; training and tuning
random forests; predictions.

### Day 5: Regression (part 2)

Using decision trees and random forests for regression. Introduction to
regularisation (Ridge, LASSO and Elastic Nets).
