## Summary of the course

In this course we will introduce the basic ideas and algorithms of supervised
learning and we will implement them using R programming language. A brief
theoretical overview of the so-called learning setting will be provided, then
the main focus will be on showing practical analysis and modelling of data
related to healthcare.





## Learning outcomes

+ To understand concepts of machine learning for healthcare and compare and test
a range of techniques.

+ To classify features of data sources, analysing and interpreting the outputs
of machine learning techniques in the context of practical solutions in the area
of healthcare.
